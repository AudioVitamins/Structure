# Structure

A little plugin to help balance out all the tracks prior to mixing. 

## Using the plugin

When analysing a track to mix, make sure you pick the loudest part of the track and if you have any tracks that are not playing any audio in that part, make sure you go and find their loudest parts and put their instance of Strucutre into analysis mode and play that section through, otherwise you'll end up with exceptionally louod parts that might make you jump or worse ;)

This plugin uses the JUCE library

Disclaimer: 7th Feb 2022 the code has not been touched since 2016, am not sure what state it is in and have not had time in the last couple of years to maintain / keep up to date with the JUCE library releases.
